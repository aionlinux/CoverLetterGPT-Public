    patterns = memory_analytics.identify_learning_patterns(feedback_history)
    
    # Should detect improvement patterns
    improvement_patterns = [p for p in patterns if p.pattern_type == "improvement"]
    assert len(improvement_patterns) > 0
    
    # Patterns should have high confidence
    for pattern in patterns:

    """Test graceful handling of various error scenarios"""
    error_scenarios = [
        ValueError("Invalid input"),
        ConnectionError("Network timeout"),
        MemoryError("Insufficient memory")
    ]
    
    for error in error_scenarios:
        result = error_handler.handle_error(error, context)
        
        # Should handle gracefully without crashing
        assert result["handled"] is True
        assert "recovery_applied" in result
