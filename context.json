With over 5 years of experience building scalable applications in healthcare technology, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to mission-critical systems that improve patient outcomes.\n\nMy background aligns well with your requirements. I've spent the last few years developing full-stack applications using Python and JavaScript, with extensive experience in React for frontend development and Node.js for backend services. I'm comfortable working with PostgreSQL databases and have experience optimizing queries for performance at scale.\n\nWhat particularly draws me to this role is the healthcare focus. In my previous position at TechHealth Solutions, I led development of a HIPAA-compliant patient management system serving 500K+ patients. I understand the unique challenges of healthcare technology—the need for absolute reliability, security, and compliance while maintaining excellent user experience for both providers and patients.\n\nI have solid experience with AWS cloud services including EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS, along with containerization using Docker and Kubernetes for deployment and scaling. I've also worked extensively with RESTful API design and microservices architecture, which I see are important for your platform.\n\nI'd be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how my healthcare technology experience and technical skills could contribute to your team's mission.\n\nBest regards,\nAlex Developer"
